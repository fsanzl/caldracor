# CalDraCor (Calderón Drama Corpus)

The 201 dramas comprised in the **Cal**derón **Dra**ma **Cor**pus were converted to [TEI](https://tei-c.org/) in a joint effort headed by Prof. Dr. Hanno Ehrlicher and coordinated by Dr. Jörg Lehmann at the University of Tübingen, [Institute of Romance Languages and Literatures](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/philosophische-fakultaet/fachbereiche/neuphilologie/romanisches-seminar/home/), and by the research group coordinated by Dr. Simon Kroll at the University of Vienna, [Institute of Romance Studies](https://romanistik.univie.ac.at/).

Full texts were taken mainly from the [Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/), from the edition of the comedias published in the Biblioteca Castro (directed by Luis Iglesias Feijoo), from the edition of the comedias published in the Biblioteca Áurea Hispánica (directed by Ignacio Arellano), and from other sources. Conversion from HTML to TEI as well as from txt to TEI was done with XSLT scripts written by Dr. Fabian Schwabe (University of Tübingen, Master Profile 'Digital Humanities') and [txt2tei](https://github.com/fsanzl/txt2tei) by Fernando Sanz-Lázaro.
